# FeedFW

##Project MVP

Register and sign in users; users can post links w/ commentary;
page for each user displaying their posts (prettily) and global
page displaying all user posts (prettily); users can comment on
each other's posts.

##Technologies

React and React-Router, Firebase.io and superagent, JS/HTML/CSS

##Next Steps

All the pseudocode, refactor the pseudocode, potentially refactor
MVP (since a user-driven content aggregator can go a number of
different ways) - ~2d

##Bonuses

Users can upvote and downvote each other's posts, global display
page can order posts by top-voted, most-commented, etc.
Users can sign up/in with Facebook, Twitter, etc.
Users can add topic tags to posts and display posts sorted by
topic tag
RSS API for publication of/subscription to user feeds, etc. (??)

Takehome: Basically Slashdot but less (particular-)community-
and more user-curation-oriented
